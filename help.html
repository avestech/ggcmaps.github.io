    <h5>More About GGC Map</h5>
    <p>If you want to view a specific building, click on it. You will know it can be selected by hovering over the building in question because it will darken as the mouse hovers on it.</p>
    <h5>Building</h5>
    <p>After selecting a building, you will now see the inside of the building including rooms, hallways, doors, labels, restrooms, and elevators. Rooms that are labeled and are selectable will show a lighter shade of green. Clicking on a room highlights it yellow.</p>
    <p>To view an alternate floor, click on the far right drop-down and choose your desired floor.</p>
    <h5>Zooming In &amp; Out</h5>
    <p>For computer, mouse wheel may be used to zoom in or out. In addition to this, at the bottom right, there are a plus sign (+) for zooming in, a reset button to restore the default view of the current map, and a minus sign (-) for zooming out.</p>
    <p>For mobile device pinching away from a center point in between two fingers yields a zoom-in at that center area. Pinching towards a center point yields a zoom-out in that center area.</p>
    <h5>Search Bar</h5>
    <p>An alternate method of navigating through the campus is using the search bar. The search bar can accept a building letter followed by a room number (i.e. A1290), or you can search for some rooms by name (i.e. Game Room). You can either press enter after entering the room number or hit the search icon itself. If the same building is desired, you may enter a room number without a letter, which assumes again that it is in the same building.</p>
