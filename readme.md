### Description
This project was started by [Mike Deiters et al](https://github.com/soft-eng-practicum/ggcmaps#fall-16---created-by), in Fall of 2016. It has since been picked up for continuation by [David Rivera et al](https://github.com/soft-eng-practicum/ggcmaps#current-members-spring-17), to further develop its features, and fix bugs as our Software Development II project.
